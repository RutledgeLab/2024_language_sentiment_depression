## \data

### FOLDER CONTENTS
* `study[1|2]_data.csv` contains de-identified data files for each study 1 and study 2
  - Each CSV file includes the key sentiment measures, including averaged human sentiment scores, ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) sentiment measures, and LIWC sentiment measures.
  - Participants who dropped out may still have LIWC sentiment scores but are missing human and ChatGPT sentiment scores (e.g., Study 1 Participant ID 5). The drop-out participants were excluded from all our analyses, and thus we did not collect their human and ChatGPT sentiment scores to reduce analysis costs.
  - Text data of written responses provided by each participant are not included to protect confidentiality. While the open-ended questions asked participants not to include any identifiable information, some responses contained information that may be sensitive and personal to the participants.

* `\SI` includes data csv files for replicating the key analyses reported in the SI Appendix.
